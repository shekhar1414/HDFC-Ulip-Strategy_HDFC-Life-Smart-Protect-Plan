Phased Allocation Strategy (long-term growth + progressively reduce risk before maturity)

| Years    | Midcap / Momentum | Flexi Cap | Bluechip / Large Cap | Balanced / Debt |
|---------:|-------------------:|----------:|----------------------:|-----------------:|
| 0–10     | 80%               | 20%       | 0%                    | 0%               |
| 11–15    | 60%               | 20%       | 20%                   | 0%               |
| 16–20    | 40%               | 0%        | 40%                   | 20%              |
| 21–24    | 25%               | 0%        | 45%                   | 30%              |
| 25–28    | 10%               | 0%        | 40%                   | 50%              |

**Why:** early years prioritize high growth (midcap + flexi). From year 11 onward we introduce bluechip for stability and gradually move to Balanced/Debt in the last 3–7 years to protect value.
